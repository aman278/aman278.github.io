    <h3>Java game : Pakour escape game</h3>
    <p>
My first offical programming project in java was based on a lot of different game
I have played or watched people play.It is a game where you have to jump from platform
to platform jumping over different monsters and collecting coins to reach a ladder
that takes you into the next level.The game is set so that if you fall off a platform
you fall into monsters which will make the game reset and cause you to die.The levels get
progressivly harder and the jumps become harder to make,making my game challenging and fun.
